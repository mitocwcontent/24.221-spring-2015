Course Overview
---------------

Metaphysics is the study of stuff in the most abstract and fundamental sense. Metaphysicians ask, with hopefully a bit more sophistication, the kinds of questions little kids often wonder about. This might seem trivial, but the puzzles are genuine and hard! Here are a few that we'll think about in this class:

_What exists?_ I'd like to think I do. But what about Sherlock Holmes? How many things exist? Well, there are clouds in the sky. How many? It's tough to say: Their boundaries are fuzzy.

_What is time?_ Does it pass? Can we travel to the past? What would that even mean?

_What am I?_ Am I my body? Am I my mind? Can I survive being teleported, if that involves an instantaneous molecule-by-molecule reconstruction of me in some distant location? What if the original "me" is still around after the reconstruction?

Prerequisites
-------------

MIT students were required to take one philosophy course prior to this one.
